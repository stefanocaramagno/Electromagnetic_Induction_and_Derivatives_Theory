# Electromagnetic Induction and Derivatives Theory

**Hello everyone!**

My name is [Stefano Caramagno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanocaramagno), and I'm pleased to present this repository containing a project on **electromagnetic induction and derivatives theory**. <br>
This project was completed as **Final Project** for my [Scientific High School Diploma with a focus on Applied Sciences](https://www.2superioreaugusta.edu.it/indirizzo-di-studio/liceo-scientifico-opzione-scienze-applicate/#art-par-descrizione) at [Istituto Superiore 2¬∞ "A. Ruiz" Augusta - SR](https://www.2superioreaugusta.edu.it/).

## üåç Context

This repository includes two main documents: a slide presentation and a written report. <br>
These materials were developed to explore the principles of electromagnetic induction and the concept of derivatives in physics and mathematics, respectively.

## üéØ Objectives

- **Understanding Electromagnetic Induction**: Gain insights into the relationship between electric and magnetic fields and how changing magnetic fields can induce currents.
- **Learning Fundamental Physics and Math Concepts**: Develop a deeper understanding of the physical laws governing electromagnetic phenomena and the mathematical principles of derivatives.
- **Practical Application**: Apply these concepts to real-world scenarios, such as explaining the functioning of electric motors and other devices relying on electromagnetic induction.

## üìÇ Contents

- **Slide Presentation**: A detailed visual exploration of electromagnetic induction, including experiments and key principles such as Faraday's Law and Lenz's Law.
- **Written Report**: An in-depth written analysis covering both electromagnetic induction and the mathematical foundation of derivatives, including their applications in various scientific contexts.
- **Experiments and Case Studies**: Practical examples and experiments demonstrating the principles discussed in the presentation and report.
